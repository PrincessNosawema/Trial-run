## QA Agent Analysis

### Assumptions

I assumed the author intended to maintain a professional, authoritative tone suitable for B2B RevOps practitioners. I treated grammatical errors as objective mistakes and the contradiction between lines 45 and 47 as a factual inconsistency requiring attention.

### Issues Found

### Line 9 — 🟡 `medium` · `grammar` · Confidence: 100% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Subject-verb agreement error: 'teams knows' should be 'teams know'.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Most revenue teams know that their CRM is only as good as the data inside it.`

### Line 11 — 🔴 `high` · `grammar` · Confidence: 100% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Homophone error: 'there both right' should be 'they're both right'.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Sales and marketing keep arguing about pipeline health, and they're both right: the pipeline looks fine in Salesforce, but the underlying data tells a completely different story.`

### Line 13 — 🟡 `medium` · `grammar` · Confidence: 100% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Missing apostrophe in 'Its'.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `This isn't a people problem. It's a systems problem.`

### Line 19 — 🟡 `medium` · `grammar` · Confidence: 100% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Missing apostrophe in 'its'.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Before we go into solutions, it's worth being specific about what bad data actually looks like in a RevOps context...`

### Line 45 — 🔴 `high` · `consistency` · Confidence: 90% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Logical contradiction: Line 45 claims a 20-person team generates 200-400 activities, but line 47 claims the same team generates over 1,200.
*No direct fix provided.*

### Line 110 — 🟡 `medium` · `grammar` · Confidence: 100% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Incorrect use of apostrophe in 'number's'.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Plot these weekly. If the numbers go up after you implement an automation, that automation is working.`

### Line 130 — 🟡 `medium` · `grammar` · Confidence: 100% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Missing apostrophe in 'Its'.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Data quality in CRM isn't a one-time cleanup project. It's an ongoing operational discipline...`

### Line 132 — 🟡 `medium` · `tone` · Confidence: 90% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Informal address 'you guys' is inappropriate for a B2B practitioner audience.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `The teams that don't? Well, they keep doing the quarterly cleanup sprint, wondering why the numbers don't add up, and keep rebuilding the same dashboards on top of the same bad data.`

## QA Agent Analysis

### Assumptions

I assumed the tone should be professional and authoritative, removing colloquialisms. I treated redundant statistics as errors and flagged unsubstantiated ROI claims as high-severity issues.

### Issues Found

### Line 13 — 🟡 `medium` · `tone` · Confidence: 90% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Use of 'honestly' and 'super-charges' is overly informal for a B2B practitioner audience.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `It is a systems problem. Automation is the primary lever for resolving these issues permanently.`

### Line 45 — 🟡 `medium` · `consistency` · Confidence: 95% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** The text repeats the exact same statistic about 20-person sales teams and activity volume in line 47, creating redundancy.
*No direct fix provided.*

### Line 77 — 🔴 `high` · `factual` · Confidence: 85% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Claiming a '3:1 improvement in LTV:CAC ratio' solely from data hygiene automation is an unsubstantiated, hyperbolic metric that lacks credibility.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Teams that deploy the complete four-layer stack consistently see measurable improvements in pipeline velocity and forecast accuracy within the first two quarters.`

### Line 99 — 🟡 `medium` · `tone` · Confidence: 90% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** Use of 'super important' is colloquial and lacks the professional register expected by the target audience.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `This is a critical requirement that many teams overlook: you must measure the quality of your CRM data over time, rather than relying on point-in-time snapshots.`

### Line 124 — 🟡 `medium` · `clarity` · Confidence: 80% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** The jump from 'automation logic outside the CRM' to 'sales reps will naturally close more deals faster' is a logical leap that lacks a clear causal link.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `By decoupling automation logic from the CRM, you ensure system stability and scalability. This foundation of reliable data governance directly supports improved lead routing, more accurate forecasting, and increased sales productivity.`

**Rationale:** Removed informal filler words ('honestly', 'super-charges') to align with a professional B2B practitioner tone.

## QA Agent Analysis

### Assumptions

I assumed the target audience is a sophisticated B2B practitioner base that values professional, concise, and data-driven language. I treated minor spelling inconsistencies (UK vs US) as errors and informal conversational asides as tone violations.

### Issues Found

### Line 9 — 🟢 `low` · `clarity` · Confidence: 90% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** The phrase 'and yet, paradoxically' is redundant and informal.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Most revenue teams know that their CRM is only as good as the data inside it. Recent industry surveys indicate that 82% of revenue teams report significant data quality issues, yet only about a third of companies have automated processes for remediation.`

### Line 43 — 🟡 `medium` · `tone` · Confidence: 85% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** The parenthetical '(which, respectfully, never works)' is overly conversational and subjective for a B2B technical guide.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `2. Rely on reps to maintain data integrity (a process that historically lacks the necessary consistency to scale)`

### Line 46 — 🟢 `low` · `clarity` · Confidence: 100% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** The term 'organisations' uses British spelling while the rest of the text uses American spelling (e.g., 'categorize', 'standardize').
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `organizations`

### Line 111 — 🟢 `low` · `tone` · Confidence: 80% · SVR: ❌
**Issue:** The phrase 'across the board' is a cliché that lacks the precision expected by a RevOps audience.
**Agent 1 Suggested Fix:** `Teams that maintain this discipline often see significant improvements in pipeline velocity and forecast accuracy.`

**Rationale:** Corrected spelling to match American English conventions used throughout the document.

**Rationale:** Removed cliché and replaced with specific, outcome-oriented language relevant to RevOps metrics.
